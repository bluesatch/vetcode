    <h2>About Me</h2>

Here's some more detail about me.</p>

    <img src="media/daddybug.JPG" alt="daddybug"><!-- images-->
    <p>I go by the name DJ Daddy Bug. I love to spin vinyl. I'll play anything from hip hop, disco, funk, jazz, rock, or pop. If it grooves, I'll spin it.</p>
    <h4>I love to collect vinyl</h4>
    <img src="media/manroom.JPG" alt="manroom">
    <p>Currently, I own about 1800+ albums. I buy from online stores like <a href="http://www.vinylmeplease.com/">Vinyl Me Please</a> and Discogs. But mostly, I buy from <a href="https://offbeatjxn.com/">Offbeat</a>.</p>
    <h4>I also have <a href="https://jamescrow.bandcamp.com/">three rap albums</a> of my own.</h4>
    <img src="media/albums.JPG" alt="albums">
    <p>I have created three albums. They are titled:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Black Codes</li>
        <li>Religion Guns Money</li>
        <li>Devil Music</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Who knows? If I feel like it, I will record another one.</p>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>I love to watch sports...and used to love playing them. I'm a longtime fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Dallas Cowboys. I'm also a hockey fan. I was previously a fan of the Philadelphia Flyers and Washington Capitals. I'm currently a fan of the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
    <p>Baseball is my favorite sport. My favorite positon to play was catcher. Even though, I'm a Dodger fan, my two all-time favorite players were Giants, Barry Bonds and Willie Mays.</p>
    <h3>Arts</h3>
    <p>Not only do I love music, I'm also a fan of visual art, however, <strong>I cannot draw!</strong> I like to buy art, particularly from friends and local artists. I also love to read and write poetry. I have a poetry book, <em>Beautiful Thoughts from the Ugly Poet</em>.</p>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <p>Cooking is yet another passion of mine. Eating out is ok. But I'd rather be in the kitchen because it gives me another avenue to create.</p>
